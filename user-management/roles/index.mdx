  <Step title="Provide a Name and Description">
    Descriptions may seem redundant, however they are useful for users who may be new to the organization when trying to decide what role to assign another user.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Assign Permissions">
    Permissions control what a user may or may not access while using Titanbase. As a general rule of thumb, the least amount of privileges should be assigned to users so they can complete their day to day work.
