An **Account** is your personal login to Titanbase. It is tied to your email address and password, and it is what you use to sign in to Titanbase. You can have only one account per email address.

A **Profile** (also known as an Agency Profile) is tied to an organization or agency that you are a part of. You can be a member of multiple organizations, and each organization will have its own profile. Your profile contains information about the organization, such as its name, address, and phone number. It also contains your role within the organization, such as admin or member.

When you sign in to Titanbase, you are signing in to your account. Once you are signed in, you can switch between the different profiles that you are a part of.
