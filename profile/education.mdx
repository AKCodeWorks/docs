# Uploading Education Records

You can upload your education records by visiting the **Education** tab on your agency profile and clicking the **New Record** button.

## Types of Education Records

Education records are organized into the following categories:

- **Certifications/Licensures:** For professional credentials like EMT certifications or RN licenses.
- **Organizational Training:** For in-house training, required onboarding, or other agency-specific programs.
- **Formal Education or Other Records:** For college degrees, professional memberships (e.g., Six Sigma belts), or any other education that doesn't fit the above categories.

## Expiration Dates

You can set an expiration date for each record. If you leave the expiration date blank, the record will be set to never expire.

## Uploading Images

You may upload an image of your certification or education record. Please note that attachments count towards your organization's 25GB storage limit.

## Editing Records

To edit a certification or education record, it is best to delete the old record and/or add a new one with the updated information.
