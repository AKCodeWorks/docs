# Notification Settings

You can choose how you want to receive notifications for different topics within your organization. The available options are:

- **Email Notifications:** Receive updates and alerts via your registered email address.
- **SMS Notifications:** Get notifications sent directly to your verified phone number.

## SMS Notifications

To receive SMS notifications, you must first verify your phone number. To learn more about verifying your phone number visit [Verify a Phone Number](/profile/phone-verification).

Once your phone number is verified, you can enable SMS notifications for the topics you care about.


## Choosing Notification Topics

You can customize which topics you receive notifications for, and select your preferred delivery method (Email or SMS) for each topic.

## Opting Out of SMS Notifications

You can opt out of SMS notifications at any time by replying **STOP** to any notification message. Please note:

- Replying STOP will block all SMS notifications from Titanbase, including those from other profiles and organizations. This is due to carrier restrictions on opt-out clauses.
- If you want to opt out of notifications for just a single organization, update your profile notification settings.
- If you accidentally opted out, you can text back **ENROLL** to re-enable SMS notifications, or contact support at [support@titanbase.app](mailto:support@titanbase.app) for assistance.
