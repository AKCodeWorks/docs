A **profile** represents your identity within a specific organization. Each profile is scoped to the organization it belongs to and does not carry over into other organizations.

## What You Can Manage in Your Profile

- **Avatar:** Update your avatar, which is displayed to other members of the organization.
- **Contact Information:** Keep your contact details up to date for communication within the org.
- **Notification Settings:** Customize how and when you receive notifications from the organization.
- **Certifications:** Upload and manage certifications relevant to your role in the organization.

## Organization-Specific

All profile settings and information are unique to the organization associated with that profile. Changes made to your profile in one organization do not affect your profiles in other organizations.
