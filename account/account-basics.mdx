# What is an Account?

An **account** is a unique identity within the system that allows a user to log in and access resources. Accounts are essential for authentication and security, as they are directly tied to a user's login credentials and password.

## How Accounts Are Created

Accounts can be created in two main ways:

1. **Added to an Organization:**
	- When a user is added to an organization, an account is automatically created if the email address provided is not already associated with an existing account.

2. **Manual Account Creation:**
	- Users can also create an account manually by signing up with their email address. If the email is not already attached to an account, a new account will be created.

## Account Login and Password

The account is what you use to log in to the system. Your password is securely attached to your account, ensuring that only you can access your information and resources.

## Merging Accounts

Users have the ability to merge multiple accounts if needed. [Learn how to merge accounts here.](/account/merge-account)
