## How to Merge Accounts

1. Go to your account settings page.
2. Scroll to the bottom of the page to find the merge option.
3. Enter the email address of the account you want to merge in, along with the password for that account.
4. Confirm the merge.

## Important Notes About Merging

- **No Duplicate Profiles in One Org:** You cannot have two user profiles for the same organization on one account. If a conflict is detected (i.e., both accounts have a profile for the same org), that profile will be skipped during the merge. You will still need to access that profile using the account you are merging in.
- **No Conflicts:** If there are no conflicts, all profiles from the merged account will be transferred to your current account, and the merged account will be deleted.
- **Sign In After Merge:** After merging, you will sign in using the account you were logged into when you performed the merge. The merged account credentials will no longer be valid.

This process helps keep your profiles organized and ensures you have a single login for all your organizations.
