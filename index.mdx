## Before You Get Started

Some actions within Titanbase require the role you have been assigned to have certain permissions. This is so users cannot make changes within the system they are not supposed to. If a certain permission is required, it will be displayed at the top of the page. [Click here](/roles/index) to read more about roles and permissions.

Titanbase is currently in open beta. We are accepting feedback on how the site operates from a usability standpoint, feature requests, and more. If you would like to contribute to the future of Titanbase please feel free to provide feedback via support ticket.
